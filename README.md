# Neural_Style_Transfer
Implementing Neural Style Transfer with pretrained VGG-19

In this repo, An image is going to be generated using the style fo one omage and the key features from the second image and for that purpose and for efficiency, pretrained VGG-19 model is used. 
## Following is the VGG-19 architecture
